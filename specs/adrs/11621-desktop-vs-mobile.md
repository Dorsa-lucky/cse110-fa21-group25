# Whether we are creating Desktop or Mobile product for our MVP

* Status: decided
* Deciders: Dorsa, Quoc, Ruby, Ting-Yun, Jerry, Justin, Reyner, Yoomin, Jenny <!-- optional -->
* Date: 2021-11-6 


## Context and Problem Statement

For our first product, we can either focus more on the desktop site or mobile site development.

## Considered Options

* Mobile Site Focused
* Desktop site focused


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Desktop Site Focused

## Reasons for Choosing Option 2

* Mobile Site is more difficult to develop and test becaues that would require making the website responsive to a wide variety of screen sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios. 
* We would need to consider very carefully how to fit GUI elements etc. 
* In contrast with a desktop site we can easily develop because most screen sizes have been standardized as the 16:9 aspect ratio.
* It is also easier to test on desktop because we can create a local server.
* If people are searching/browsing for  recipes, doing on a desktop is ideal since they have access to a keyboard to search specifically for what they are looking for.

## Pros and Cons of the selected Option.
**Pros:** Ease/speed of execution of developing an MVP for desktop site. It is also easier to test.

**Cons:** Many people are on their phones while they are trying to cook. It is also  more convinient have the recipe on hand instead of on a desktop that may be far away. More decisions needed on whether to include development for mobile site after MVP has been delivered.
