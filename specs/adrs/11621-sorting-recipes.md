# Recipe Sorting
* Status: proposed
* Date: 2021-11-06

## Context and Problem Statement

For our project, we want to have a sorting features for the recipes we have on our app. Having specific sorting categories would allow user to navigate through different recipes available in our app easier.


## Considered Options

* Most recent published recipes
* Alphabetical order of recipe's title
* Tags (Based on our tagging feature)
* Duration to cook the recipe
* Cumulative rating of a recipe

## Decision Outcome

So far, our team agree to implement all of the above options except for the rating sorting, as rating recipe is currently considered as an add-on feature to implement if we have more time to work on our project.


## Reasons for Choosing Options
* We have the necessary data/features to sort according to the options we agree to
* User generally accustomed to alphabetical and numerical sorting (intuitive)
* Flexibility in searching specific recipes through the tagging sorting
