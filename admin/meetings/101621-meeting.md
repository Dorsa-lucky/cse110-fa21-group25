- Ruby stated that she had done research regarding roles and what a generic "software development/engineering" team consists of. 
  -  Stated that most team consists of Product Manager, Developers, Testers, Designers, etc. 
  -  Ruby shared an image in the Slack groupchat referencing the slides that Cora (the TA) had previously sent her which can be found [here](https://cse110-fa21-group25.slack.com/archives/C02GDM40MT8/p1634413446006800). 
-  Ruby asked the team their opinions on having multiple developers. 
    - Many of the team members have expressed their interest in being developers or part of the development team. 
    - Yoomin stated that it would be better to have at least two people working per role/area (example: 2 designers, 2 testers, etc.)
      - Team members agreed and thought that it would be a good idea. 
- Ruby has raised a question if anyone is familiar with what a "Build" engineer is responsible for. 
  - Team members were unsure
  - Ruby has been assigned to message Cora regarding the "Build" role and will message the group once she has responded.
- Ruby asked if any team members are interested in any particular role aside from developer. 
- Ruby raised concern that not many team members were interested in the tester role despite it being a crucial part of the team and asked if anyone would be interested.    
  - Pranav volunteered to be a tester. 
  - Justin volunteered to be a tester. 
- Ruby stated that two people have previously volunteered to be Designers and that they should assigned those roles. The team agreed. Therefore, Dorsa and Victoria will be the designers. 
- Ruby stated that the remainder of the team will be Developers for the time being until we figure out what a "build" role is. 
- Ruby and Jenny will be responsible for communications and planning for the team. 
- Since all roles have been assigned, Ruby stated that the meeting can end earlier than anticipated and scheduled. 
- Meeting ended at 12:51PM.     
  
## Unfinished Business
1. Determine and clarify what a "build" engineer is and does. 

## Action Plan

- Ruby: Message Cora regarding the "Build" role and @channel when a reply is received.
