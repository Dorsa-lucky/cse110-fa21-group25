### Description
Our team name is "Runtime Terror" we are a diverse group of students focused on studying software engineering skills and gaining practical industry experience through project coursework and exploration. Our brand image/mascot is an image of a scared hamster representing the "terror" of poorly written programs with high runtime. Our team colors can be found under /admin/branding and the color scheme was chosen with the image of a cheetah in mind with blacks, yellows, and oranges. As a team we value punctuality, respect for one another, and proper communication skills.
