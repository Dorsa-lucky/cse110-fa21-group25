### Description
Our team name is "Runtime Terror." We are a diverse group of students focused on studying software engineering skills and gaining practical industry experience through project coursework and exploration. Our brand image/mascot is an image of a scared hamster representing the "terror" of poorly written programs with high runtime. Our team colors can be found under /admin/branding and the color scheme was chosen with the image of a cheetah in mind with blacks, yellows, and oranges. As a team we value punctuality, respect for one another, and proper communication skills.

## About Us

**Quoc-Zuy Do:** I'm a third year computer engineering major interested in web-dev and general software engineering. I am most familiar with C or C++, but I am also proficient in Java, Arduino C, and Python to some extent (MATLAB too if you count that!).

**Justin Nguyen:** I'm a third year computer science major interested in general software engineering. I am most familiar with Java, Python, and JavaScript. During my free time, I enjoy running, surfing, and watching movies/TV.

**Yoomin Oh:** I'm a second year transfer student and computer science major interested in machine learning, Blockchain, and cryptocurrency. I feel comfortable to use C++, python, and matlab. 

**Dorsa Tayebipour:** I'm a fourth year computer engineering major interested in software engineering. I'm familiar with C, C++, Java and Python. 

**Jieun Lee:** I'm a fourth year computer science major interested in software engineering and web development. I am skilled in C++, Java, Python, HTML, JS, and CSS. 

**Jerry Zhang:** I'm a third year computer engineering major interested in machine learning and software engineering. I know Python, C/C++, and Java. In my free time I enjoy reading and hanging out with people (doing whatever).

**Reyner Santonius:** I'm a fourth year computer science major, music minor, interested in software engineering. Python and C++ are my go-to languages, but I'm also familiar with Java, C and JavaScript. I like to exercise on a regular basis and play music in my free time.

**Ting-Yun Yeh:** I'm a second year transfer student, majoring in Math - CS, interested in cryptography, network, security, blockchain, cloud, web, econ. I know C++ (most familiar), Python, HTML/CSS, and x86 Assembly Language. I am an amateur translator, translating among Mandarin, English, Japanese, and German. Anime Fan

**Pranav Janjam:** I'm a third year math-computer science major interested in full-stack software engineering. I am most familiar with Java, Python, C, C++, and HTML/CSS. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, as well as listening to music and going to concerts.
