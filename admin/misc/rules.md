## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
- Slack (primarily for updates, announcements, etc)
- Zoom (for meetings unless in-person if necessary)

**Expectation of Communication**
Our primary means of communication will be through Slack. Team members are expected to respond 
within 24 hours of being contacted directly or through the @channel or @everyone on Slack. 
It is each team membersâ€™ own responsibility to check Slack at least once a day to ensure that they 
do not miss a notification or important announcement. Important announcements will be known to each 
team member via @channel or @everyone on Slack by a team leader. Additionally, private messages will also 
be sent if a specific team member needs to be contacted (e.g., status reports, progress). 

Regarding Zoom, team members are also encouraged to show up to group meetings via Zoom if they are able to. 
If specific team members are required to show up to a meeting but are not able to attend, a 24 hour notice is needed.
This is to ensure that the meeting can be rescheduled or revised accordingly.
