## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
- Slack (primarily for updates, announcements, etc)
- Zoom (for meetings unless in-person if necessary)

**Expectation of Communication**
Our primary means of communication will be through Slack. Team members are expected to respond 
within 24 hours of being contacted directly or through the @channel or @everyone on Slack. 
It is each team members’ own responsibility to check Slack at least once a day to ensure that they 
do not miss a notification or important announcement. Important announcements will be known to each 
team member via @channel or @everyone on Slack by a team leader. Additionally, private messages will also 
be sent if a specific team member needs to be contacted (e.g., status reports, progress). 

Regarding Zoom, team members are also encouraged to show up to group meetings via Zoom if they are able to. 
If specific team members are required to show up to a meeting but are not able to attend, a 24 hour notice is needed.
This is to ensure that the meeting can be rescheduled or revised accordingly.

## Meetings
**Weekly Meetings (Day/Time)**
- Mondays 9PM - 10PM 
- Wednesdays 5PM - 6PM 
- Saturdays 12:30PM - 1:30PM 

_Note: Meetings may be skipped depending on workload (e.g., all assignments have already been completed) or if there is no purpose/reason for a meeting to take place._

**Scheduling**

There will be weekly meetings that are scheduled based on Finalized Team Availability. 
These meetings will be held every week for the remainder of the quarter unless notified by Team Leader(s) that they will not be held. 
In addition to these meetings, other meetings may be scheduled and held based on issues, individual needs, concerns, etc. 
These meetings’ time will be based on direct contact with the individuals required and needed. 

**Location**

Majority of team meetings will be held online via Zoom to accommodate as many members as possible, unless stated otherwise that the meeting will be held in-person. 

**Agendas**

There will be an agenda that team leaders will need to follow to discuss important topics that will ensure team success. Team leaders are expected to plan enough time that will cover all topics listed in the agenda unless specified beforehand (e.g., “if time permits”). Meeting agendas will be posted before the meeting begins in the #meetings channel on Slack. Team members are expected to go over the agenda so that they may plan accordingly and bring up any questions, comments, or concerns that arise. Team leaders are encouraged to stay on track for the meeting so that time is used wisely. 

**Attendance**

Team members are encouraged to attend meetings if their schedule permits, unless they are required to show up. Team members who are not able to attend meetings are encouraged to catch up by reading the “meeting minutes” for the day(s) missed. Meeting minutes are expected to be posted in the #meetings channel on Slack after the meeting ends or within the same day. Additionally, there will be instances where team members are required to attend. In this case, team members must be present and arrive before the meeting or on-time. If specific team members are required to show up to a meeting but are not able to attend, a 24 hour notice is needed. This is to ensure that the meeting can be rescheduled or revised accordingly.

## Team Expectations

**Quality of Work**

The level of quality expected from each team members’ own individual work is to provide a sufficient amount so that the project progresses optimally and efficiently. This includes completing tasks so that the team is able to make deadlines on time. Team members are encouraged to work with fellow team members, meaning, asking for help when needed, reaching out when a certain task is outside the scope of your expertise/role or the workload is too heavy, technical difficulties, etc.. If group presentations arise, team members are expected to put in an ample amount of time, effort, and work for the preparation and completion of the assignment (e.g., providing their own videos, snippets, research) as well as participating in the actual presentation. 

**Fulfilling Quality of Work**

There will be regular status reports provided by each team member that will be based on the progress of their work, concerns, questions, ideas, and comments that may arise. Additionally, team members will receive frequent feedback from Team Leaders and other team members (if necessary) to ensure that expectations and needs are being met. All team members will have their own assigned portions of the project and future assignments that they will need to complete. Work will be distributed and divided as evenly as possible based on role, expertise, and fairness on all portions of the project and assignments. 

**Participation**

Each team member is expected to communicate on a regular basis through Slack, especially if any questions or concerns arise. Team members are also expected to mention when they complete their tasks/assigned work in the #assigned-tasks channel. Additionally, team members are expected to perform pull requests on a separate feature branch whenever they want to merge any feature development(s) and/or bug fix(es) into the master branch. 

Team members are expected to routinely express their own ideas, solutions, and opinions during meetings and on Slack. Whether it involves their own task(s) or the task(s) of another group member. Team leaders are also expected to ask for team member input. Team members will provide a “safe” environment. This means that team members should be open to/offer constructive criticism, so long as it is in a respectful manner. 

**Own Personal Accountability**

You are expected to show up on time to meetings, especially if you are required to show up. Meetings are scheduled ahead of time which gives you an opportunity to plan accordingly. You are expected to stay for the duration of the entire meeting if possible. If you are not present or leave early, it is your own responsibility to catch up by reading/referencing the meeting minutes which can be found on Slack in the #meetings channel. It is also your own responsibility to check the “Assigned” portion of the meeting minutes, assigned issues on github, and/or the #assigned-tasks channel on Slack to see if any tasks were assigned to you during the meeting. Additionally, you are encouraged to participate in team meetings/discussions, especially if you have concerns or questions. 

You are responsible for completing your assigned tasks and/or portions of the assignment before the given deadline from your Team Leaders. If you feel as though you will not be able to complete your assigned tasks and/or portions of the assignment, you must communicate with your Team Leaders and/or team members so that we, as a team, are able to plan accordingly and complete the assignment(s) on time. 

***Most importantly, you are responsible for checking Slack regularly for announcements, updates, messages from team members, etc.***

## Conflict Resolution and Consequences

**Signs of Infraction**

If there are signs or complaints that a team member is breaching this contract, not cooperating with team members, and/or failing to fulfill their obligations, they will initially be approached by team leaders to try and figure out the issue. If the specific team member continues, they will be given a warning as a final courtesy. Receiving a warning means that from then on, they are expected to complete their tasks and obligations without failure. 

**Continuation of Infractions**

If for any reason a team member continues to fail their obligations or breach this contract for an extended period of time after they have received a warning, the team leader(s) will approach the TA/professor so that the proper punishment can be given. In addition to the punishment from the TA/professor, the individual will also receive a poor peer evaluation from the team. 

**Team Conflict**

When team conflict arises for minor reasons (e.g., feature request, specific fonts), the team will meet as a group to figure out what the issue is. Afterwards, if needed, the team will take a vote on what to do to resolve the issue. Once a vote has been made on an issue of this type, the team member(s) involved are prohibited from straying from the results of the vote. Meaning, if the vote is not what they wanted it to be, despite what they want, they must fulfill their tasks based on the final team’s vote. Failure to do so is an infraction of the team rules and contract and there will be consequences. 

Team members are expected to treat each other with respect. Intentionally disrespecting a team member will not be tolerated and should be reported to team leaders immediately so that they can take the proper steps necessary.
