## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
- Slack (primarily for updates, announcements, etc)
- Zoom (for meetings unless in-person if necessary)

**Expectation of Communication**
Our primary means of communication will be through Slack. Team members are expected to respond 
within 24 hours of being contacted directly or through the @channel or @everyone on Slack. 
It is each team members’ own responsibility to check Slack at least once a day to ensure that they 
do not miss a notification or important announcement. Important announcements will be known to each 
team member via @channel or @everyone on Slack by a team leader. Additionally, private messages will also 
be sent if a specific team member needs to be contacted (e.g., status reports, progress). 

Regarding Zoom, team members are also encouraged to show up to group meetings via Zoom if they are able to. 
If specific team members are required to show up to a meeting but are not able to attend, a 24 hour notice is needed.
This is to ensure that the meeting can be rescheduled or revised accordingly.

## Meetings
**Weekly Meetings (Day/Time)**
- Mondays 9PM - 10PM 
- Wednesdays 5PM - 6PM 
- Saturdays 12:30PM - 1:30PM 

_Note: Meetings may be skipped depending on workload (e.g., all assignments have already been completed) or if there is no purpose/reason for a meeting to take place._

**Scheduling**

There will be weekly meetings that are scheduled based on Finalized Team Availability. 
These meetings will be held every week for the remainder of the quarter unless notified by Team Leader(s) that they will not be held. 
In addition to these meetings, other meetings may be scheduled and held based on issues, individual needs, concerns, etc. 
These meetings’ time will be based on direct contact with the individuals required and needed. 

**Location**

Majority of team meetings will be held online via Zoom to accommodate as many members as possible, unless stated otherwise that the meeting will be held in-person. 

**Agendas**

There will be an agenda that team leaders will need to follow to discuss important topics that will ensure team success. Team leaders are expected to plan enough time that will cover all topics listed in the agenda unless specified beforehand (e.g., “if time permits”). Meeting agendas will be posted before the meeting begins in the #meetings channel on Slack. Team members are expected to go over the agenda so that they may plan accordingly and bring up any questions, comments, or concerns that arise. Team leaders are encouraged to stay on track for the meeting so that time is used wisely. 

**Attendance**

Team members are encouraged to attend meetings if their schedule permits, unless they are required to show up. Team members who are not able to attend meetings are encouraged to catch up by reading the “meeting minutes” for the day(s) missed. Meeting minutes are expected to be posted in the #meetings channel on Slack after the meeting ends or within the same day. Additionally, there will be instances where team members are required to attend. In this case, team members must be present and arrive before the meeting or on-time. If specific team members are required to show up to a meeting but are not able to attend, a 24 hour notice is needed. This is to ensure that the meeting can be rescheduled or revised accordingly.
